# Contributing Guide

We employ an enterprise-style agent workflow. Code is organized into department directories, each managed by a department head agent. Architectural changes are reviewed by a board-of-directors agent.

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch in the appropriate department folder.
2. Make your changes following module encapsulation principles for that department.
3. Submit a pull request. Documentation-only changes do not require tests. Logic changes must pass the linter and test suite.

We appreciate your contributions!
