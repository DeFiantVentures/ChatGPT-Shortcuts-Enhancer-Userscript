## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This project uses an agent-based workflow that organizes code by department-level subfolders. Each department has a lead responsible for module scope, and a board-of-directors agent oversees architectural reviews. Please submit pull requests to the relevant department folder. Documentation-only changes skip tests, while logic changes trigger the linter and test suite.
